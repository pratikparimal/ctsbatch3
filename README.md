    To get http-server working on your machines

    JavaScript
        - Basics 
            Doesn't have strong data typing
            Basis content the data is derived
            Overloading can be avoided
            typeof() 
            Cross Compatible JS 
            JS is not a pure object oriented language   
        - Functional style of programming
            Treat functions as first class objects, assign functions to variables
            Pass functions as arguments
            Return functions from functions
            Scopes
            Every function will have its own scope
        - Debug
        - Callbacks, Promises, Ajax
            Function callbacks
            Callback expose your functionality, Callback hell
            Replace to callbacks is Promises (latest version of JS)
            Modern Ajax API's support promises (axios, fetch(native))
        - DOM Manipulation
            Document as an object (tree like structure)
            Write to DOM, page re-render
        - JQuery
            Library of reusable JavaScript functions
            Make our JS code smaller in size
            Majorly about DOM manipulation (read & write to DOM)
        - AngularJS
            Data binding feature - Not doing a great deal of DOM manipulation, framework takes of it.
            Your code is really short and crisp, dont write much JS
            Opinionated framework, takes care of most UI concerns
    
    Javascript vs JQuery vs AngularJS
